PWM_PWM_LED

RGB LED Controller with Demedukit
ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ English:
This project controls an RGB LED using STM32's PWM signals. It cycles through 50 predefined colors with smooth fading. The LED's red, green, and blue channels are driven by TIM16 (red) and TIM1 (blue/green) at 16-bit resolution. Colors defined in 0-255 range are automatically scaled to 0-65535. The fade effect is achieved by gradually interpolating between colors in 10ms steps.

ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· TÃ¼rkÃ§e:
Bu proje, STM32'nin PWM sinyalleriyle bir RGB LED'i kontrol eder. 50 Ã¶nceden tanÄ±mlanmÄ±ÅŸ renk arasÄ±nda yumuÅŸak geÃ§iÅŸler yapar. KÄ±rmÄ±zÄ± (TIM16), mavi ve yeÅŸil (TIM1) kanallarÄ± 16-bit Ã§Ã¶zÃ¼nÃ¼rlÃ¼kte sÃ¼rÃ¼lÃ¼r. 0-255 aralÄ±ÄŸÄ±ndaki renkler otomatik olarak 0-65535'e Ã¶lÃ§eklenir. Renkler arasÄ± geÃ§iÅŸler, 10ms'lik adÄ±mlarla kademeli olarak yapÄ±lÄ±r.
